# gaokun-android installer — Huawei MateBook E Go (SC8280XP / gaokun3)
#
# Run this from an arm64 Linux live environment on the target machine — our
# own gaokun3 live USB, or any Ubuntu/Debian arm64 live USB. It repartitions
# the chosen disk, writes Android, and installs systemd-boot.
#
#     git clone https://github.com/vahiru/gaokun-android && cd gaokun-android
#     sudo scripts/install-gaokun3.sh /path/to/release-dir
#
# The release directory is what you download from Releases: boot.img plus
# super.img.zst (the .zst is streamed straight onto the disk — no need to
# decompress it first, and no 12 GiB of scratch space).
#
# ⚠️ THIS ERASES THE WHOLE TARGET DISK. Everything on it — Windows included.
#    Installing *next to* another OS is the graphical installer's job.
#
# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# This file is deliberately thin. Every step that touches the disk lives in
# scripts/live/installer-lib.sh, which the graphical installer uses too.
# Until 2026-09-24 this script carried its own copy of all of it, and the two
# copies had drifted apart (different rescue partition, different default boot
# entry, one kernel command line read from boot.img and one hand-kept and
# stale). One implementation, two front ends.
#
# Why the layout looks the way it does (sizes in installer-lib.sh):
#
# This machine is UEFI, not fastboot. There is no serial console. systemd-boot
# loads the kernel, DTB and ramdisk as plain files from the ESP.
#
#   esp        300M  systemd-boot + kernels + ramdisks.
#                    ★ PARTLABEL must be exactly "esp": the boot_control HAL
#                      finds it through /dev/block/by-name/esp to mirror the
#                      active A/B slot into loader.conf. The customary name
#                      "EFI system partition" has spaces and cannot be used
#                      by-name. UEFI identifies the ESP by partition *type*
#                      GUID, so renaming it is harmless.
#   misc        4M   bootloader_control (A/B slot state). Required:
#                    get_misc_blk_device() only accepts an fstab entry whose
#                    mount point is exactly "/misc" — there is no by-name
#                    fallback — and libboot_control cannot start without it.
#   metadata   32M   Android metadata.
#   boot_a/b   64M   Standard Android boot images, in AB_OTA_PARTITIONS.
#   super      12G   system/system_ext/product/vendor (Virtual A/B: one
#                    physical copy plus COW snapshots in userdata).
#   gk3rescue   1G   Optional rescue system: a squashfs mounted read-only from
#                    this partition, its writable layer in RAM
#                    (docs/stage7-live-installer.md). Installed only when
#                    rescue.squashfs + initramfs.img are available — in the
#                    release directory, or on our live USB. Two boot entries
#                    use it: one with slot a's kernel, one with slot b's.
#                    The old 24 GiB "clone whatever live system you booted"
#                    rescue is gone.
#   userdata   rest  /data. Last on disk so it can be grown without moving
#                    anything.
